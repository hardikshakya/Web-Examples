In July 1987, DC released variant editions of Justice League #3 and The Fury of Firestorm #61 with a new DC logo. 
It featured a picture of Superman in a circle surrounded by the words "SUPERMAN COMICS". 
The company released these variants to newsstands in certain markets as a marketing test.
On May 8, 2005, a new logo (dubbed the "DC spin") was unveiled, debuting on DC titles in June 2005 with DC Special: The Return of Donna Troy #1 and the rest of the titles the following week. 
In addition to comics, it was designed for DC properties in other media, which was used for movies since Batman Begins, with Superman Returns showing the logo's normal variant, and the TV series Smallville, the animated series Justice League Unlimited and others, as well as for collectibles and other merchandise. 
The logo was designed by Josh Beatman of Brainchild Studios and DC executive Richard Bruning.    
In March 2012, DC unveiled a new logo consisting of the letter "D" flipping back to reveal the letter "C" and "DC ENTERTAINMENT".
The Dark Knight Rises was the first film to use the new logo, while the TV series Arrow was the first series to feature the new logo.    
DC Entertainment announced a new identity and logo for another iconic DC Comics universe brand on May 17, 2016. 
The new logo was first used on May 25, 2016, in conjunction with the release of DC Universe: Rebirth Special #1 by Geoff Johns.
